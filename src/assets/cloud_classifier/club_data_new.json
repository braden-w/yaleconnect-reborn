    "mission": "The US-China relationship is widely recognized as the most important bilateral relationship in the 21st century. The United States and China dominate the world in terms of economic output, military spending, and geopolitical influence. Leaders from both the US and China have endeavored to build a symbiotic relationship between the two countries. China Hands Magazine seeks to extend the project of strengthening US-China relations to students from both countries.\nWe see a dearth of student publications dedicated to promoting US-China relations on campuses in the US or China. In order to fulfill this mutual intellectual curiosity of students from both countries, we have built a platform for discussion and education about China-related issues and US-China relations.",

CASA is heavily involved with the Asian American Students Alliance / Political Action committee and works cooperatively with all the other organizations on campus in order to provide the optimal power and voice for the Chinese American community. In addition to nurturing political awareness concerning Chinese Americans, Chinese American Students Association also strives to promote social interaction and unity through numerous popular activities like hosting our annual Lunar New Year event, Cultural Show, mixers, and other social activities. CASA also plays a sizable role in organizing and driving many activities during Asian Pacific American month. Others include study breaks, karaoke nights and movie screenings. CASA also reaches beyond the Yale community by taking trips to New York's Chinatown, creating intercollegiate coalition with other CSAs such as Harvard's CSA and Columbia's CSC and inviting guest speakers to Yale. CASA also plays a role locally in New Haven, with a community outreach program seeks to encourage interaction between Yale and Chinese American children from the New Haven area.",

For over 40 years, first-year students have participated in an exciting week of engaging activities intended to facilitate their transition to Yale alongside their peers, CC counselors, and many members of the Yale staff. Activities include discussions with faculty experts about ethnicity, nationality, and race; panels on academic expectations by faculty; presentations on campus life by students; and group visits to local points of interest such as the Yale College cultural centers, local and University museums and parks.\n\u201cWithout CC, I wouldn\u2019t know the Yale that I know.

For ECY, radical inclusion is God\u2019s idea behind creating the wildly diverse human race, so we welcome all of God\u2019s children \u201cfrom every tribe, language, people and nation,\u201d as well as from every gender expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, immigration status, and economic background.

Next, through voter registration, social campaigns, and distribution of best practices, we hope to leverage technology along with comprehensive analysis of the practices of high turn-out nations in order to bolster robust voter engagement. Finally, we advocate at the local level in our Civic Education division through outreach to local high schools in our community and engage in civic education workshops for those approaching the voting age.

Our Party pays homage to the original Federalists\u2014Hamilton, Madison, and Jay\u2014and to their astute perception of human nature and good governance as illustrated in the Federalist Papers. These men understood that laws and norms may change with the times, but arbitrary intervention in the process is a short and nasty route to social caducity. When a people begin to think that they can improve society infinitely by incessant alteration of the legal and moral order, nothing remains settled, and every dear attachment, every right, and every bit of property are endangered.\nThe ladies and gentlemen of our Party hail from many backgrounds and schools of thought but are bound together by a shared pursuit of the truth. You will find that the friendships forged in that pursuit are neither geographically nor temporally bound as we are always seeking to know not merely what is most efficient, fair or equal, but what is right and good. Outside of debates Federalists spend time together over meals, toasting sessions, movie nights, basketball games, and other impromptu gatherings.

    "mission": "For a very long time, surgery was not included in the discussion of how healthcare could be improved worldwide, especially in the most remote corners of the earth. Only recently has surgery been brought to the table, being called the \u201cforgotten step-child\u201d of global health by Paul Farmer and many others. At the very core, global surgery is \"a field that aims to improve health and health equity for all who are affected by surgical conditions or have a need for surgical care, with a particular focus on underserved populations in countries of all income levels, as well as populations in crisis, such as those experiencing conflict, displacement, and disaster.\u201d Important to this effort is all aspects of surgery, including anesthesia, OB/Gyn, and nursing.\n\u200b\nCurrently, 5 billion people around the world do not have adequate access to basic surgical care. Worse yet, the disparity in surgical care is stark, with the poorest 30% of the world receives only 3-6% of operations, whereas the richest 30% receives almost 75%. 17 million people die and 77 million DALYS are lost each year because of this, greater than HIV/AIDS, malaria, and TB combined. Our global economy could lose 21 trillion dollars between 2015 and 2030, with 12.3 trillion lost by low- and middle-income countries, so the lack of surgical care worldwide is also a significant detriment to the progress of humanity. 2.2 million more surgeons, anesthetists, and OB/Gyns (SAOs) and an investment of $350 billion dollars is needed to prevent this from happening, with a goal to raise the operative volume of countries to 5,000 per 100,000 population, meaning an increase of 143 million more surgical procedures per year. It can be easy to get lost in the numbers, but ultimately, health is a human right, and no one should have to live with a condition that would have been treated had they been born somewhere else.\n\u200b\nSo the bigger question becomes how we address this need for surgical care. In the past, this has almost exclusively involved efforts such as week-long surgical missions and the provision of money/resources in order to acutely work on the problem. However, the field has evolved with the creation of the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery, which called for a more in-depth analysis. Their major report from spring 2015 outlined an approach through investigation, innovation, and implementation, pointing out that research, technology, and capacity-building efforts were necessary to advance the field. In addition, they did a thorough economic analysis which showed that upscaling the number of surgeons and operations alone will not work - an economic approach that helps decrease catastrophic health expenditure for patients and their families is necessary. As the Lancet Commission encompasses almost 110 different countries, efforts have now been set on working at the highest level - with governments, health ministers, and financial officers - to enact changes in policy and infrastructure for whole countries to improve people\u2019s access to surgical care.\n\u200b\nUltimately, whether you are interested in surgery/anesthesia/OBGyn, global/public health, economics/finance, policy, technology/engineering, education/empowerment, statistics/research, or any combination of these, you have a very significant contribution to make to this growing field. And no matter how young or old you are, no matter how little or how much you can contribute, your involvement in global surgery is incredibly necessary and valuable.\n*Reference: Meara, J, Leather A, Hagander L, et al.

By pairing members with deaf residents in Marrakech's Winsted home, Happy Hands hopes to cultivate meaningful friendships and help combat the isolation and dehumanization often experienced by members of the deaf community. Our goal is to drive home the idea that small acts of kindness, such as befriending someone and treating them with respect, can go a long way in bringing people joy. We hope to demonstrate the importance of compassion, especially towards a community that, unfortunately, tends to get overlooked in society. In an effort to spread awareness of deaf culture, we would love to take part in Dwight Hall's Days of Service, where interested students could volunteer with us for a day and immerse themselves in the deaf/ASL community.",

Beyond that, though, we also pay attention to the rising number of people in Western society who have a lively interest in spirituality but feel no connection to traditional forms of church and worship. So Marquand is also actively engaged in original, creative, and experimental forms of worship, both for committed Christians and for those exploring the faith.\nAttend Marquand five days in a row, and you may encounter an orthodox liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, a Mardi Gras worship party, a service of silent Lenten contemplation, a chapel converted into one of Dante\u2019s spheres of heaven, or a worship caf\u00e9. As a student at Yale Divinity School, you may well have taken part in designing one of these services.\nFrom traditional worship to brave experiment, from ancient liturgy to post-modern praise, from the heart of America to global worship, Marquand\u2019s mission is to be worshipful, educational, and ecumenical, and we look forward to welcoming you here. \nServices take place in Marquand every weekday classes are in session. All services are open to the community.\nFor more information, contact marquand@yale.edu.",

It also brings critical human rights discussion to the wider university community.

In addressing these needs, the Schell Center seeks to increase knowledge and understanding of international human rights issues; to equip lawyers and other professionals with the knowledge and skills needed to advance the cause of international human rights; and to assist human rights organizations.\nThe Schell Center coordinates a diverse program of human rights activities that serve students and scholars at Yale and contribute to the development of the human rights community locally and internationally.  The Center:\nSponsors frequent panels, lectures, and conferences, including the weekly Human Rights Workshop: Current Issues and Events;\nPromotes activism through summer and post-graduate fellowships;\nSponsors visiting human rights scholars and practitioners;\nActs as a liaison between the Law School and the human rights community;\nAdvises students about human rights research and about job and career opportunities;\nFosters human rights activities throughout Yale University",

Topics for the SIG will cover sustainability in supply chains, innovations in materials, opportunities for justice, equity, diversity and inclusion in outdoor spaces, economic development in the rural United States, and others. Additionally, confronting racism both within Yale and in the outdoor recreation industry at large is central to the mission of ORec SIG. Additionally, ORec SIG notes that the ability of people across the country to enjoy time outside is enabled by land that was stolen from Indigenous peoples.\u00a0\nORec SIG seeks student contributors to the \"New Directions in Outdoor Recreation\" publication, which showcases student writing on various aspects of the Outdoor Recreation Industry. https://medium.com/new-directions-in-outdoor-recreation-at-yale-fes",

    "mission": "Founded by Professor Paul Gewirtz in 1999 as the China Law Center, the Paul Tsai China Center is the primary home for activities related to China at Yale Law School. The Center is a unique institution dedicated to helping advance China\u2019s legal reforms, improving U.S.\u2013China relations, and increasing understanding of China in the United States.\nIn interaction with research and teaching at Yale, the Paul Tsai China Center works collaboratively with a broad range of top experts in the Chinese government, universities, and civil society on concrete projects designed to have a positive practical impact. Our Center has an established track record in helping to further a broad range of legal reforms in China. Cooperative projects have focused particularly on issues of judicial reform, criminal justice reform, administrative and regulatory reform, and public interest law. Projects involve a range of activities, including workshops and seminars in the United States and China, research visits to Yale and to China, and books or articles by Chinese or U.S. scholars.\nThe Paul Tsai China Center also conducts research and convenes high-level Track II and Track 1.5 meetings on a broad range of U.S.\u2013China foreign policy issues. The centerpiece of this work is the Dialogue on U.S.\u2013China Relations, a thriving channel since 2012 for top U.S. and Chinese figures to develop and provide timely policy recommendations for both governments. The dialogue convenes carefully selected former officials and practitioners to work toward strategic and diplomatic innovation over the full range of issues in the U.S.\u2013China relationship, with dual emphases on security and economic issues. The Center also hosts top Chinese and U.S. scholars and policy practitioners at Yale as guests and visiting scholars who produce original research and interact with the broader Yale community.\nIn 2016, Yale Law School received an extraordinary gift of $30 million in honor of its distinguished alumnus, the late Dr. Paul C. Tsai, \u201954 LL.M , \u201957 J.S.D., to support the continuing work of the China Center. This generous gift was given by Paul Tsai\u2019s son, Joseph C. Tsai, Yale College, B.A. \u201986; Yale Law School, J.D. \u201990. In recognition of this gift, the Center was renamed the Paul Tsai China Center.\nThe Director of the Paul Tsai China Center is Professor Paul Gewirtz. Prior to establishing the Center in 1999, Professor Gewirtz was on leave from Yale University from 1997\u20131998 and was a part of President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, where he served as Special Representative for the Presidential Rule of Law Initiative at the U.S. Department of State. In that post, he developed and led the U.S.\u2013China initiative to cooperate in the legal field that President Clinton and China\u2019s President Jiang Zemin launched at their October 1997 Summit.",

    "mission": "Graduate and Postdoc Teaching Development initiatives serve many populations -- graduate students, professional school students, and postdoctoral fellows.  We offer an extensive set of workshops for new teachers that encourage creativity and promote good teaching practices.  These workshops include the Fundamentals of Teaching (tailored to particular disciplines) and Advanced Teaching Workshops, on themes ranging from active learning to universal design, to inclusive assessment. We also offer support for graduate and postdoc teaching through classroom observations and one-on-one consultations, which allow new teachers to share challenges in a neutral space.  Graduate students and postdocs who want to do more intensive teaching development can pursue the Certificate in College Teaching Preparation (CCTP), the requirements for which include teaching, participating in workshops, observing others\u2019 teaching, and preparing a capstone teaching portfolio.  At the heart of our program is a group of 22 McDougal Teaching Fellows who run many of our workshops and manager classroom observations.  Other opportunities for graduate student development include the Associates in Teaching program, which allows a graduate student to teach as instructor of record in partnership with a faculty member, and the Teaching Innovation Projects grant, which invites fresh ideas for using digital tools in the classroom.  The Graduate Teaching Program also serves the teaching needs of individual departments, promotes faculty-student mentoring, and responds to emerging developments in research about teaching.",

Through lectures and workshops, we hope to explore when, how, and why to recommend and help people begin and maintain lifestyle changes related to physical activity. So when someone comes to you wanting to reduce their blood pressure or improve their insulin sensitivity--and they want to do more than just take medications--you can confidently help them explore a variety of evidence-based options. We plan to discuss research on physical activity, aerobic exercise, and anaerobic exercise and how they affect many of the most common health maladies we\u2019re likely to encounter as healthcare providers. We also plan to lead hands-on workshops in the Harkness gym so that you can learn how to implement the research. We don\u2019t intend to train you to become personal trainers--doing so is beyond the purview of this endeavor--though we hope you\u2019ll be familiar enough with these ideas and methods so that you can make confident suggestions to patients. Of course, we also value your feedback, so if there\u2019s anything you\u2019d like us to address, then please let us know and we can try to do so.",

The Center brings together leading experts and practitioners from the public and private sectors to address cutting-edge questions of health law and policy, and to train the next generation of top health lawyers, industry leaders, policymakers, and academics.\nThe Center was established to meet a critical need for a new academic and legal-professional discipline that responds to the rapidly evolving environment of health care and its centrality in the nation\u2019s economy and government. \u201cHealth law\u201d as a field of study in law schools is a relatively new concept; it has yet to be embraced within the field of \u201cpublic law,\u201d alongside similar disciplines like labor law and environmental law. Among the few health law centers at U.S. law schools, the Solomon Center is unique in its focus on the government\u2019s role in health care as well as health care business and physicians and scientists themselves. The Solomon Center distinguishes itself by doing what Yale does best: focusing on law as a tool to affect governance, industry, and the academy at the highest levels.\nThe Center\u2019s programming includes many course offerings, both academic and experiential; career planning; academic research, policy work and litigation briefs; and numerous high profile panels and conferences that bring academic, government, and business leaders in health care to the Law School. We host a steady stream of academic visitors from all disciplines to enrich our programming and course offers, and we actively support student research, field work, and publications. Our work is highly interdisciplinary. Building on established relationships with the Yale School of Medicine, Yale Cancer Center, Yale-New Haven Hospital, Yale School of Management, and Yale Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics, the Center brings together all that Yale has to offer to make a difference both at Yale and beyond.",

One of the founding parties of the Yale Political Union, the IP is easily the Union\u2019s largest party and the only one that adheres to no specific ideology or political viewpoint; instead we aim to foster robust, open, and wide-ranging political discourse. \nOur weekly debates are open to the entire Yale community and address challenging political, cultural, and philosophical issues. Our debate format is easily accessible and relies on Robert\u2019s Rules of Order to ensure that all voices are heard and respected. We encourage everyone\u2013the casual visitor and committed member alike\u2013to ask tough questions, give speeches, and actively explore their own convictions. Recently, we have debated some of the following resolutions: Resolved: Kill the Death Penalty; Resolved: Hypocrisy is Not Immoral; Resolved: WikiLeaks is Good for America; Resolved: Go West, Young Man; and Resolved: Defund the Arts \nThe Independent Party\u2019s motto is \u201cHear All Sides,\u201d and this is an imperative by which we live. At our debates, you will find bold expressions of opinions from across the political spectrum. One could say that the IP is home to libertarians, socialists, neo-conservatives, hard-line moderates, and almost everything in between\u2013but in fact, we are a group of students who resist the claustrophobic categories of \u201cliberal\u201d and \u201cconservative\u201d popular in today\u2019s politics and reject the partisan pressures that demand adherence to a mass-produced political platform, in favor of intellectually honest and authentic approaches to forming and evaluating our worldviews. In the Independent Party we believe that openness of mind is the truest mark of genuine intelligence. \nAlong with our debates, the Independent Party hosts a wide variety of social events throughout the academic year. Whether watching a movie, arguing over drinks, or toasting at Mory\u2019s, IPsters are always having fun together. As we like to say, we take our ideas seriously, but we don\u2019t take ourselves too seriously. The IP is one of the closest groups of friends you will find at Yale; the friendships formed in the IP stay with us forever. \nWe also go to New York City every semester to meet with prominent politicians, journalists, business people, artists, and media personalities. In recent semesters, we have meet with former New York Mayor Ed Koch, Obama Administration health care expert Dr. Ezekiel Emmanuel, Editor-in-Chief of The New Atlantis Eric Cohen, CEO of the New York Public Library Tony Marx, UN Ambassador John Bolton, Historian Eric Foner, and the late William F. Buckley, Jr. \n\u201cYale,\u201d George Pierson famously said, \u201cis at once a tradition, a company of scholars, a society of friends.\u201d The Independent Party is much the same. Please join us at one of our debates this Fall and learn firsthand what this party is all about.",

YDS has a rich abundance of individuals passionate about preaching the Word from a wide array of different Christian traditions, and this groups taps into that by providing a space for preachers to collaborate. The primary event of this group during the 2020-2021 season has been our Word at Nine podcast, which provides YDS students with opportunities to preach a sermon on an episode of the show. The previous year, the group primarily consisted of an event called Preacher\u2019s Hour, which is essentially office hours with fellow students to talk about preaching, either through workshopping sermons that people are currently working on or through discussing topics relevant to preaching in general. Preacher\u2019s Hour has been on pause during the pandemic, but may resume in the future.",

The Yale Alley Cats, Inc. is registered as a non-profit organization, and we are therefore exempt from taxes. Officers include the Business Manager, the Pitchpipe (or Musical Director), the Rush Managers, and the Tour Managers. These officers are appointed unanimously by the members of the current group after a series of presentations and deliberations in the spring. The Alley Cats\u2019 funds are used to cover the necessary expenses of the group, including travel, lodging, album production, publicity, and other basic operating costs. As one of Yale\u2019s oldest and most renowned a-cappella groups (having been established in 1943), The Yale Alley Cats strive to uphold the strong tradition of a-cappella music that has become such a signature of Yale\u2019s student life.",

Gender and sexuality have historically been central to our work and now serve as one of many points of entry into intersectional struggles and coalition building. \nWe seek to foster a self-critical and self-reflective community, intentionally directing our time, resources, and programming toward dismantling systems of oppression through education and action. We aim to provide a physical and intellectual space where all are able to collaborate, learn, and unlearn without judgment. We strive to make our work accessible to everyone who wishes to engage with it, firmly believing that this work cannot and should not be done in isolation. \nThe Women\u2019s Center may be spatially enclosed within and funded by Yale, but all work within the university is intertwined with New Haven. We strive to build a deep and long-standing relationship with the city: realizing our mission demands that our community and our efforts extend far beyond our campus.",

Lawyers are using videos to present evidence, closing arguments, and victim-impact statements; advocates are making viral videos to advance public education campaigns; and scholars are debating ideas in a multimedia blogosphere.  Everyone\u2019s doing it.  But no one is really teaching it \u2014 or reflecting upon it.  We see training in visual advocacy \u2014 effectively evaluating and making arguments through videos and images \u2014 as a vital part of our legal education.\nThe Visual Law Project fosters a community of students invested in visual advocacy. We enable students to produce intellectually stimulating documentary films on legal issues to advance public debate. We organize an annual reading group centered on visual jurisprudence. We connect YLS students with innovative practitioners and thinkers through our speaker series. VLP operates both within and beyond the law school, and seeks to collaborate on interdisciplinary projects with graduate students in other programs.",

    "mission": "As of 1981, Yale\u2019s vibrant a cappella scene featured a dozen underclassman groups of every variety. However, seven senior women felt that a key part of their musical experience was missing \u2013 a senior group. These seven seniors founded Whim n\u2019 Rhythm as an answer to the decades-old tradition of The Whiffenpoofs. Thirty-six years later, the 13 singers of Whim n\u2019 Rhythm represent the best and most experienced female musicians of the senior class.\nEach year, Whim has continued to grow into a full-force presence on Yale\u2019s campus and on both the national and international stages. The group tours domestically and in the greater New England area yearly, visiting locations from New York and Los Angeles to Hong Kong and Cairo, and recently founded a full-fledged Alumnae Board to help build the group\u2019s legacy from beyond Yale\u2019s campus. Post-commencement, the group traditionally takes a five-to-seven week World Tour, hitting nearly every continent.\nProspective singers audition in the spring of their junior year to be tapped into Whim for their senior year the following fall. Whim represents nearly every underclassman singing group, a variety of residential colleges and academic majors, and hometowns ranging from coast to coast.",

Fellows directly report to senior members of their offices and work with a variety of university staff, at all levels. Fellows most often combine day-to-day duties with responsibilities for specific projects that utilize their research abilities and other higher-level skills. Organizational and writing skills are particularly valuable, as is the ability to work well with multiple constituencies: staff of all kinds (clerical, technical, service, maintenance, managerial, and professional), faculty, alumni, and students.   \nFellows meet regularly together, including for lunchtime conversation with the president, provost,  secretary, and other university leaders. These conversations about roles and responsibilities, and the career paths that led people into academic administration, give fellows a broad understanding of many facets of working in higher education.",

Students can also learn about health-related issues through various lectures, panel discussions, and events held throughout the year. Event topics include medically-related volunteer opportunities, conversations with admissions officers from various medical schools and physicians from a wide range of specialties, and local and international outreach work. Additionally, we understand the importance of teamwork and mentorship in fostering a community of future doctors and leaders in medicine by holding an annual mentoring program that connects Yale undergraduate students with Yale medical students.",

    "mission": "The Yale Physics Professional Development Organization (YPPDO) is a student-led organization that aims to expose physics science graduate students and postdocs to non-academic career opportunities and prepare them for their career transition after Yale. Furthermore, along with the tangible deliverables of this program will hopefully come a culture change within the physics department and Science Hill in general, one that does not attach a stigma to pursuing work outside of academia. At the same time, graduate students who choose to stay in academia will be able to do so out of an informed choice and will be better equipped for the academic job search.\nThe 2015 GSAS STEM survey for physics PhD students revealed that 46% of surveyees have career goals that involve becoming faculty members, 63% agree that their program is preparing them for their current career goals, 29% agree that Career Services has been beneficial for their career development, and only 8% of students use the Office of Career Strategies \u2018a fair amount\u2019. According to our own departmental statistics over the last 20 years, only 11 out of 310 PhD graduates are currently registered in teacher/lecturer/faculty positions. These statistics highlight two main motivations for the YPPDO program: (1) over half of physics graduate students do not plan to pursue professorships and of those that do, only a few will be given the opportunity and (2) physics graduate students do not feel they are acquiring the skills to pursue work outside of the academy. \nAlthough this program and budget has originated within physics, we welcome students from all physical sciences across Science Hill to participate in events. In alignment with Yale\u2019s mission to increase the visibility of STEM, we would be excited to work with our colleagues from closely-related departments such applied physics, astronomy, geology & geophysics, engineering, and chemistry to expand the YPPDO program and bring speakers from diverse geographic and educational backgrounds.",

    "mission": "The Yale Bands is a thriving cultural community. Its members are given opportunities to prepare and perform great music; learn about the arts and their place in society and international cultures; and develop skills to become leaders. Through a robust series of musical activities, many Bands members work with and become serious performers, conductors, composers, arrangers, writers, archivists, historians, photographers, producers, choreographers, media producers, critics, and teachers. Band members develop and master these skills through service to the University, performing and producing commencement music, benefit concerts, university ceremonies, theater shows, international tours, reading sessions for classes, and special events.\nThe YPMB is one of twelve scatter-style marching bands in the country. What does this mean? Most marching bands spend their time on field spelling their name in script or making a swirly line formation while playing the complete works of Andrew Lloyd Webber. We perform halftime shows composed of comedy segments, during which we spell witty things on the field and play really cool rock music. Between formations we run around wildly (hence the clever name \u201cscatter band\u201d). For example: in the past we\u2019ve done a sketch about the rise and fall of Saddam Hussein as a Yale professor, accompanied to \u201cIt\u2019s Gonna Be Me\u201d and \u201cLive and Let Die,\u201d one in which we played the \u201cGodfather\u201d theme and dug up Jimmy Hoffa on the 30-yard-line (this was during our trip to Giants Stadium) and the unforgettable George W. Bush sketch, which involved a line of white-shirted bandies and the playing of Eric Clapton\u2019s \u201cCocaine.\u201d We are also a pep band. During the winter we support Yale\u2019s hockey and basketball teams every weekend. This time of year often leads to playoff travel; we\u2019ve been to Lake Placid, Ann Arbor, MI, MADISON SQUARE GARDEN, and more. We are a mobile attack unit. If there\u2019s anywhere on the Yale campus (or, really, the East Coast - we\u2019re flexible) that needs some relief from pretension, we\u2019ll be there to provide. \nWe could go on for pages trying to tell you what we are. You\u2019d be best off to show up and find out, really. You won\u2019t be disappointed.\nFor more, visit us here: https://bands.yalecollege.yale.edu/bands/yale-precision-marching-band/frequently-asked-questions",
